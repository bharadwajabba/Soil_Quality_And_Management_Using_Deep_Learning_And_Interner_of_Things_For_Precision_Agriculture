# Soil_Quality_And_Management_Using_Deep_Learning_And_Interner_of_Things_For_Precision_Agriculture
Developed an intelligent soil monitoring system using IoT sensors (pH, moisture, NPK, EC) and a stacking ensemble model (XGBoost, MLP, HGB) to classify soil quality and recommend corrective actions and crops. A Flask web app provides real-time insights, supporting sustainable precision farming.
